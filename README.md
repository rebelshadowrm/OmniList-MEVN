# OmniList-MEVN
--------------------------------  
Final Solo Project utilizing Mongoose (MongoDB), Express.js, Vue 3(installed with Vite), and Node.js  
This project is a progressive enhancement of my solo projects in the past, and is my most ambitious project to date.

#Goals
-------------------------------  
The main goal of the project is allow the user varying customization options within their account. Most notable is the custom theme picker.
The rest of the site will act as a fully functional anime list website, complete with discussions and reviews.
